ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data science in agriculture or any related field where I can contribute my skills and learn from others.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced statistical methods and machine learning applications in agricultural data.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about agricultural engineering, data analysis in R, or my projects related to crop performance.
